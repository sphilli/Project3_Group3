Summary:
We took 2 datasets that related to video games from Kaggle.com and proceeded to clean and engineer them in preparation for importing to SQL. After Some light SQL coding, we managed to route everything into 
our web app and then wrote JS code to give the datasets functionality in regards to the website. We then applied various CSS codes to breathe
life into our website with relative colors and also added information
as well as links to our 'About Us' page. Upon completion and testing, 
we uploaded the website to pythonanywhere.com. The dinished product can be found at http://presley202.pythonanywhere.com/
